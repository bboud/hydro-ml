# Hydro-ML

The goal of this project is to replace the need for classical hydrodynamic simulation of Quark-Gluon Plasma by converting initial state baryon distributions into final state net proton rapidity distributions using machine learning.

This project focuses on using a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network(DCGAN) to perform this operation. Modifications of this model will be performed in the future.
